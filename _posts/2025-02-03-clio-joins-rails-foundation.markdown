We’re excited to welcome <a href="https://www.clio.com/">Clio</a> as the newest Contributing Member of the Rails Foundation. Since its founding in 2008, Clio has relied on Rails to build tools that empower legal professionals to manage their practices more efficiently.

Today, Clio’s product suite is the largest and most sophisticated Rails-based system in the legal industry. The platform supports over 150,000 legal professionals globally, processing millions of transactions daily, and Rails remains at the heart of it all.

From the very beginning, the Ruby and Rails community’s commitment to learning and open-source innovation has aligned with Clio’s own mission: to transform the legal industry for all. This is largely what attracted Clio to the Rails Foundation’s mission - particularly the focus on education and documentation - both efforts to ensure that Rails will remain accessible to developers of all skill levels. 

>Rails has been at the core of Clio’s success, and joining the Rails Foundation is our way of giving back to a community that has given us so much. We’re proud to be a home for Rails developers, a part of the thriving ecosystem of companies built on Rails, and an active contributor to its future."

Clio’s engineering team has now grown to over 300 developers, building and maintaining a sophisticated ecosystem powered by multiple Rails monoliths. These monoliths form the backbone of Clio’s product suite: Grow, Manage, Payments, and Accounting. (And, yes - <a href="https://www.clio.com/about/careers/search/?teams=engineering&locations=all_locations">they are hiring</a>!)

Clio developers actively contribute to the Rails ecosystem by maintaining <a href="https://github.com/clio">open-source gems</a> focused on testing, deployment, and performance improvements. The team has also contributed patches and enhancements to the framework itself.

Clio has long been an active supporter of the Rails and Ruby community, supporting events and meetups. Those who attended Rails World in Toronto might remember Clio’s booth sponsorship and their unforgettable Day 1 party. More recently, they’ve taken their community involvement further by supporting and hosting the Toronto Ruby meetup group.

We’re thrilled to have Clio’s support, and we look forward to working with them on the foundation’s mission!
